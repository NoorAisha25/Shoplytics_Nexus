# Shoplytics Nexus – Machine Learning Project

This project uses machine learning to analyze customer shopping behavior and predict sales amounts. It focuses on building a clean, efficient ML pipeline using Python and scikit-learn.

##  Project Overview

Shoplytics Nexus applies regression modeling to e-commerce transaction data to uncover insights and predict purchase amounts. The workflow includes:

- Cleaning and preprocessing customer data
- Training a regression model to predict sales
- Evaluating model performance using MSE and R²
- Saving the trained model for future use

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.13  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- joblib (model serialization)  
- Jupyter Notebook
